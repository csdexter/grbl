* remove inversion support for STEP pins, maybe #define it out (though no LPT-driven controllers out there need it)
* decouple DIRECTION from STEP, there's no need (performance or otherwise) for them to be glued together
* UN-BUG limits.c toggle stuff (does not work in the rare case that STEP lines have been inverted). #define it out OR see below
* un-lame limits.c (inject blocks instead of stepping by hand [with acceleration], make hardware topology aware [where ma switches?], implement soft limits) OR see below
* extend stepper.c with hard limits support, this automatically makes limits.c sane (i.e. we can just ask for a X_travel + homing_threshold G00 in the right direction and tell the code we expect the endstop to trip -- instead of doing physics voodoo by injecting blocks and checking the endstop switch from limits.c)
* remove obsolete TODOs
* replace if (sys.abort) { return; } with a function or macro; also investigate if the "sprinkled calls" model should be maintained (process_runtime_command()).
--
* switch to better math (faster and smaller): use fixed point. Maybe copy stuff over from Teacup (like auto-scaling).
* switch to better math (faster and smaller): use homebrewed routines for sin/cos/tan/hypot etc.
* un-snafu #includes, align all to canonical order, remove unused
* un-snafu types, remove archaisms (like uint8_t when we actually mean bool)
* audit globals and structs, there's just too many of them to be right
--
* maybe add SPINDLE_RPM stuff (PWM)
* maybe add E_STOP stuff (freeze)
* maybe un-snafu serial.c and eeprom.c -- they look thrown together in a hurry
* maybe extend G-code with soft limit support [error/clip]
--
* more G-code stuff
--
* make a first attempt at splitting along the dotted line
* make Arduino-compatible (add .ino file, investigate why it complains about duplicate symbols in serial, #define them out)
