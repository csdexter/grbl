* remove inversion support for STEP pins, maybe #define it out (though no LPT-driven controllers out there need it)
* decouple DIRECTION from STEP, there's no need (performance or otherwise) for them to be glued together
* UN-BUG limits.c toggle stuff (does not work in the rare case that STEP lines have been inverted). #define it out.
--
* switch to better math (faster and smaller): use fixed point. Maybe copy stuff over from Teacup (like auto-scaling).
* switch to better math (faster and smaller): use homebrewed routines for sin/cos/tan/hypot etc.
--
* maybe add SPINDLE_RPM stuff (PWM)
* maybe add E_STOP stuff (freeze)
--
* more G-code stuff
--
* make a first attempt at splitting along the dotted line
* make Arduino-compatible (add .ino file, investigate why it complains about duplicate symbols in serial, #define them out)
