// Executes run-time commands, when required. This is called from various check points in the main
// program, primarily where there may be a while loop waiting for a buffer to clear space or any
// point where the execution time from the last check point may be more than a fraction of a second.
// This is a way to execute runtime commands asynchronously (aka multitasking) with grbl's g-code
// parsing and planning functions. This function also serves as an interface for the interrupts to 
// set the system runtime flags, where only the main program handles them, removing the need to
// define more computationally-expensive volatile variables.
